Scene Sorter 1.0

Overview
Scene Sorter came about through working on numerous large scale projects where it was always a pain to coordinate work in multiple scenes. With Scene Sorter you have quick access to all the scenes in your project. Switching scenes is easy, running different scenes is easy too. 

Open Scene Sorter by going to Window->Scene Sorter in the main menu bar. You can either float or dock this window, whichever you prefer. Upon opening Scene Sorter scans your folder structure for scene files include in your project. Favorite scenes can be pinned to the top of the list by clicking the "heart" icon. Click again to unpin the scene.

Fast opening is done by clicking on the Folder/Load icon next to the scene name in the Scene Sorter window.

Run any scene by clicking the Play button next to that scenes name.

Its that simple! I hope you find Scene Sorter as useful as I do. Suggestions and tech support can be sent to info@porkchopco.com

Thanks and happy Scene Sorting!
